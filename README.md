# Simple Shell Project

## What is the shell?
The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard via the terminal, and gives them to the operating system to perform.\
**To better understand how the shell actually works, you can read this [Article](https://intranet.alxswe.com/concepts/64).**

## About this project
This project is a simple version of the linux shell made for [ALX Africa](https://www.alxafrica.com/) taking part of the "Low-level programming & Algorithm - Linux and Unix system programming" projects.\
It is created using the **C programming Language** and it can do many functionalities that a real shell does.

## Essential Functionalities of the Simple Shell:
> Displays a prompt "#cisfun$ " and waits for user input.\
> Runs all commands of type "executable program" (ls and /bin/ls).\
> Runs the following build_in commands: **exit**, **env**, **setenv** and **unsetenv**.\
> Handles commands with arguments.\
> Handles the PATH global variable.\
> Handles The EOF (End Of File) condition.\
> Handles the Ctrl + C signal -> It doesn't exit the shell
